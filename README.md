# TPM034A - Machine learning for socio-technical systems (Q2 - 2025)

## 1. Introduction.

Welcome to the git repository of *TPM034A - Machine learning for socio-technical systems* course. Here, you will find notebooks and sources for lab sessions related to the course. Please review the following information carefully.

## 2. Description

Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly seen as a crucial part of the puzzle to solving the socio-technical challenges of today’s networked, urbanised, knowledge societies. Successful adoption of ML does, however, not only require skilled computer scientists that do the hard-core programming. Also, professionals need both domain knowledge of socio-technical systems and a profound understanding of ML.

This course aims to provide students in the socio-technical domain with a profound understanding of ML. It prepares students for the challenges and questions ML will pose to them in their later careers.
To this end, the course consists of three parts:

- **Part 1:** Fundamentals of ML
- **Part 2:** Explainability of ML
- **Part 3:** Applications of ML for socio-technical challenges

In **part 1**, students learn about ML fundamentals and methods. These weeks a critical technical foundation is laid for grasping the strength and weaknesses of ML for the analysis and design of socio-technical systems.

**Part 2** is devoted to the explainability of ML. For public decision-making as well as for decision-making in high-stake contexts, such as e.g. autonomous vehicles, legal systems’ transparency and explainability of the models are of critical importance. Students learn several popular explainability techniques and discuss their value for applications in socio-technical systems.

In **Part 3**, a rotating group of TPM scholars provides exemplar applications of ML in socio-tech systems. This serves two purposes: (1) to show where and how ML is applied for analysis and application in socio-technical systems, and (2) to deepen reflection on the impact of ML-based solutions and interventions on individuals, organisations, and society. Consecutively, students work in a group on a final project, building forth on one of the presented applications. This project brings together the three parts of this course. Students need to apply ML models and techniques to real-world data in a notebook, interpret, and communicate their results, taking into account the socio-technical setting through a presentation.

### 2.1. Course activities

The course consists of oral lectures, lab sessions and mini projects. The aim of the lab sessions is to show and reinforce how the ML models, explainable ML techniques and ML ideas presented in the oral lectures are put to practice. Also, they help students gather hands-on machine learning skills. The lab sessions involve a series of exercises in the form of Python notebooks.

The course consists of 2 oral lectures and 1 lab session per week. Attendance of the lectures and lab sessions is highly recommended to keep up with the course, but not mandatory.

Course activities:
- **Oral lectures:** Lecture sessions where core ML concepts, theories, and methodologies are presented.
- **Lab Sessions:** Not-graded, Hands-on programming exercises using Python Notebooks where you apply the concepts learned in lectures.
- **Mini projects:** Group-based research projects where you work on real ML applications.
- **Practical Exam:** A computer-based examination conducted in a controlled environment where you demonstrate your practical ML skills. You'll have access to completed lab sessions but no internet connection.
- **Final Exam:** Final examination covering all theoretical and practical aspects of the course.

### 2.2. Prerequisite knowledge
We expect students have taken undergraduate courses on the following topics before coming to this course.
    – Statistics & Data analyses (e.g. hypothesis testing, correlation, etc.)
    – Python programming (basic level)

### 2.3. Use of AI tools
AI tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, can be valuable aids for programming. In your later careers, you will also work in an environment where such tools are widely available. However, they cannot replace your own reasoning: you still need to conceptualise the problem, break it down, and structure it to conduct proper analysis. We therefore **encourage** you to use AI tools responsibly — as a support, not a substitute for your own thinking.  
> ⚠️ **Important:** During the *practical exam* you will **NOT** have access to these tools (since internet access will be restricted).

## 3. Q&A forum

We use the [Issues](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2025/issues) section as the Q&A platform of this course. Here, you can post your questions related to the content of the lectures, the lab sessions and technical problems with Python. Before you create a new issue, please make sure the issue has not been raised before by one of your classmates. Besides asking questions, you can comment on the earlier issues e.g. to continue the discussion. As an example, we have already created the first issue; see [Issues](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2025/issues).

To create a new issue (question, discussion or problem) in the course repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Issues" section of the course repository.
2. Click on "New issue" in the green button located at the upper right corner of your screen.
3. Add an informative title to your question or problem (e.g., "Train method from sklearn does not import in my notebook").
4. Describe your issue clearly and concisely. 
6. Click on "Submit new issue" in the green button below the text description.

After that, the lecturer or teaching assistant will reply to your question. Also, **you are allowed (even encouraged)** to reply to questions posted by your fellow students! If you know how to help your fellow student with an issue, share your thoughts!

## 4. Software requirements

In this course, lab sessions will require programming in Python. You’ll need to prepare your computer by installing and setting up essential software in order to complete this course. Specifically, you will need a Python interpreter and a code editor. The interpreter allows your computer to run Python code, and it can be installed directly from Python’s website or through third-party software like Conda or Anaconda. The code editor is where you’ll write and execute Python scripts and notebooks; examples include VS Code, PyCharm or JupyterLab.

We offer instructions for two different setup options: (1) Anaconda, and (2) Google Colab. While you can do the activities with both, we strongly recommend Anaconda. Additionally, for those with advanced experience in managing Python versions and environments, we also provide the `requirements.txt` ([file](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2025/requirements2025.txt)) file for you to create the respective environment. If you choose this method, ensure you create a virtual environment with Python version 3.12.11 for compatibility. This option is intended for students comfortable with Python’s native package manager, PIP, command line, and manual environment setup.

1. <u>Anaconda</u>: This setup involves installing Anaconda (if it isn't already installed) and configuring the required Python packages for the course. This method is commonly used in other TU Delft courses, so it may be familiar to you.
3. <u>Google Colab</u>: This option requires no installation on your computer, as you’ll work in an online environment. This makes setup easy, though it requires a stable internet connection and can sometimes be slower than the other options.


> 📋 NOTE: 
If you are unfamiliar with Python, we recommend completing **lab session 0** after you finish the workspace setup. This lab provides the necessary tools to conduct the lab sessions. It covers topics such as data structures, utilising external libraries, data exploration, visualisation, etc.
<b style="color: orange;">

### 4.1. SETUP 1: Anaconda (strongly recommended)
#### SETUP 1.1: Installing Anaconda
 * Download Anaconda for your system:
    - [Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
    - [Mac (silicon)](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-MacOSX-arm64.pkg)
    - [Mac (intel)](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)
 * Run the installer and follow the instructions.
 * Once you have anaconda installed, we need to set up an independent virtual environment that isolates all the functionality we need in this course.

*Python environments function like isolated sandboxes, each with its own versions of Python and packages. You can create, export, list, update, and remove environments as needed. Moving between environments, known as “activating” an environment, allows you to work with different setups for specific projects. When you’re finished with an environment, you can simply “deactivate” it to return to your default settings.*

For this course, we have prepared the Python evironment as recipe. With this recipe, Anaconda can create the same coding environment for all of you. The recipe can be found in this repo (`tpm034a_env.yaml`).

#### SETUP 1.2: Creating an environment from an `env.yaml` file
 * Download and unzip the `tpm034a_env` file to your computer ([download link](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2025/raw/refs/heads/main/tpm034a_env.zip))
 * Open Anaconda Navigator:
    - (1) Go to “Environments” in the left sidebar.
    - (2) Click on “Import”
    - (3) From your local drive, import the file you just downloaded (*.yaml)
    - (4) Give the environment a name (e.g., tmp034a)
    - (5) Keep the option “Overwrite exisiting environment” UNchecked. 
    - (6) Click on import (Depending on the speed of your connection, this step will take a while (but no less than 15-30 minutes))
    ![Instructions for importing a env from yml](/assets/img_imp_env.png)
 * Once you have the environment ready. We have to choose an interpreter for activating the environment.

#### SETUP 1.3: Using the new environment
 * Open Anaconda Navigator:
    - (1) Go to “Home” in the left sidebar.
    - (2) In the scroll menu, select your newly created environment (e.g., tmp034a).
    - (3) Choose the interpreter of your preferences. Click on "install", and then "lunch". The course team suggest VS Code. 
    ![Instructions for activating the new env](/assets/img_act_env.png)
* If everything was installed properly, the interpreter of your preferences in now opening with the env we just created.

### SETUP 2: Google Colab

For this option, you need a Google account, Google Chrome web browser, and a stable internet connection. Please follow the steps we've included below to set up the workspace.

* Step 1: *Download* or *clone* this repo to your computer.
	- For downloading: on the top of this site, click on (1) *<>Code* tab, then in the green button (2) *Code* and then (3) *Download ZIP* (See numbers 1, 2, and 3 on the following image). Unzip this file into a working folder of your own choice.
![img](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2023/assets/29065260/1b91d8bd-3425-43bd-819a-7ab41a199151)
	- For cloning: Open a console (*terminal* on macOS or *CMD* on Windows), locate the console where you want to get this repo, and execute `git clone ...`. The entire repo will be downloaded to your computer. (**IMPORTANT**:You need to have installed [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning)

* Step 2: Go to [http://colab.research.google.com](http://colab.research.google.com)

* Step 3: Sign in with your Google account (if you are already signed in, skip this step). If you do not have a Google account, you must (temporarily) create one.

* Step 4: Upload the Python notebook you want to work on Colab. Click on the "Upload" tab and then on the "Choose file" tab, see numbers 1 and 2 in the figure below. Then, navigate to your working folder (Step 1) and select the Python notebook (.ipynb) you want to work on (e.g. lab_session_00.ipynb).
![img](https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2023/assets/29065260/b06c76a0-3f3b-47a5-8575-1b0b80703a8c)

* Step 5: Once open, click on "View" >> "Expand sections" on the menu bar.

* Step 6: Importantly, you have to add the following cell to each notebook. This will prepare the data and environment in Google Colab. Add these lines, and replace the `X` for the right Lab Session.

```python
!git clone https://github.com/TPM034A/Q2_2025
!pip install -r Q2_2025/requirements2025.txt
!mv "/content/Q2_2025/Lab_sessions/lab_session_0X/data" /content/data
```

* Step 7: You are all set! You can work on your notebook.

Finally, note that the requirements files may be updated during the course to include more dependencies if needed.
